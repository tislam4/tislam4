- 👋 Hi, I’m Tahmid Islam, a sophomore in College. 
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of Machine Learning/Data Science with Medicine. Specifically, I want to dive into how machine learning can improve the mechanics of Orthopedic Surgery. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "Introduction to Computer Science" by Open Source Society University. In addition, I am a Human Biology Major with an intention of going to Medical School. I'm also heavily invested in Cryptocurrency. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning/Data Science with Medicine. I would like to make a blog on preventative medicine and the stuff they won't teach you traditionally in Medical School.
- 📫 How to reach me @tahmid_islam1 on twitter.
